DeepSpace GUI is a skin for Unity uGUI. It contains a scene (DeepSpaceTestScene), which allow you to see all the elements on a simple working example. 
V.1 used to be a guiskin for the now legacy pre-4.6 system, if you still need it - you can find the old package in "legacy" folder.
There are two fonts used in the skin, both are free for both commercial and private use - see .txt files for each font.

ProgressBar and Waiting animations are handled by MHAnimatedTexture script (in scripts folder). The script is added to the scene's Main Camera and defines the skin and style that should be animated, allows to define which textures to use, set fps and enable or disable auto animation.
